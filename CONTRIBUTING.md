# Contributing to kintai-bundle-timeoff

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Before You Start

This bundle is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**
(AGPL-3.0), same as [Kintai](https://github.com/AudricSan/Kintai) itself. By
contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the
same terms.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature` or `fix/my-bug`
3. Make your changes following the conventions below
4. Open a pull request against the `alpha` branch (the active channel —
   `main`, `alpha`, and `beta` are protected release-channel branches with no
   direct push; merging into one of them automatically tags and publishes a
   GitHub Release, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#release-process))
5. The `test` check (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) must pass before merge

## Code Conventions

- PHP 8.3+, strict types (`declare(strict_types=1)`) in every file
- Namespace root: `kintai\Bundles\Installed\TimeOff\` → `src/`
- Controllers: `final class`, constructor injection, signature
  `method(Request $request): Response` — route parameters are read via
  `$request->param('name')`, never as method arguments
- Persistence goes through `TimeoffRequestRepositoryInterface`, but this
  bundle does **not** bind it — it stays bound in Kintai Core's own
  `RepositoryServiceProvider` (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#architecture)
  before changing anything here, several Core components depend on it directly)
- Comments in code are written in French; everything else (commit messages,
  PR descriptions, docs) in English
- Never use inline `style="..."` in `Views/*.php` — they're rendered inside
  Kintai's own layout and should follow the host app's CSS conventions

## Running Checks Locally

There is no PHPUnit suite in this repo (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for why).
Before opening a PR, run what CI runs:

```bash
find src Views -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l
php -l routes.php
for f in bundle.json lang/*.json; do jq empty "$f"; done
```

Functional testing requires installing the bundle into a real Kintai
instance — there's no way to exercise the controllers standalone.

## Where to look first

- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — architecture, branch model, release process
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — what's been done recently
- [README.md](README.md) — what the bundle does, how it's installed
